#The above command is called shebang, it is an interpreter of the code in shell scripting that check and compiles for errors

# In shell scripting echo is used to print the statments. 
echo "Hello Schell Scripting"

#Once code was successfully return you would like to push the code to github right ? Currently your code in workplace.
# from workplace - > stagging area/temp area (add) - > local repo ( commit) - > Git main/ remote (push) 
# before you enter into staging area check the git status ( Its in Red Colour for the file)
#Now add the code into staging area ( git add <filename> ) which confirms code in stagging area ( In greencolor file name)
# this helps you to again move to unstage from green to red state (  git rm --cached <filename.sh> )
# Now commit for loca repo ( git commit -m "you pushed the latest code")
# still the code in local repo from here to remote origin (git push origin main)
